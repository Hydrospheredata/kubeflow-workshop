# Hydrosphere + Kubeflow Pipelines 

This repository shows how to orchestrate a machine learning workflow with [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) and [Hydrosphere Serving](https://hydrosphere.io/serving/).

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to a Kubernetes cluster
- [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/)
- [Hydrosphere Serving](https://hydrosphere.io/serving-docs/installation.html#kubernetes)

## Repository Structure

```
├── notebooks          - notebooks for running workshop and other required operations
├── steps              - pipeline steps executed in the workflow 
├── utils              - utility scripts to work with the cloud, orchestrator, etc.
└── workflows          - definitions of the pipelines
```

## Configuration

In order to configure execution of this workflow you have to deploy ConfigMap resource in the same namespace, where your Kubeflow instance is running. Structure of this ConfigMap should be as following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mnist-workflow
data:
  "default.tensorflow_runtime": "hydrosphere/serving-runtime-tensorflow-1.13.1:dev"
  "postgres.dbname": "postgres"
  "postgres.host": "postgres"
  "postgres.pass": "postgres"
  "postgres.port": "5432"
  "postgres.user": "postgres"
  "influx.host": "influxdb"
  "influx.port": "8086"
  "uri.hydrosphere": "https://<hydrosphere>"
  "uri.reqstore": "https://<hydrosphere>/reqstore"
  "uri.mlflow": "http://<mlflow>"
  "uri.mnist": "http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/"
```

## Operations management

* Build, test and publish all steps of the workflow
    ```
    $ make release-all-steps
    ```
* Build and publish all steps of the workflow without testing
    ```
    $ make release-all-steps-raw
    ```
* Compile and submit origin pipeline for execution
    ```
    $ REGISTRY=<your_registry> TAG=<tag_of_the_image> KUBEFLOW=<kubeflow_instance_uri> EXPERIMENT=Default CONFIGMAP=mnist-workflow make origin
    ```
